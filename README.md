# Multilevel MDA-Lite Paris Traceroute (MMLPT)

Multilevel MDA-Lite Paris Traceroute is a portable (Linux, MacOS, Windows) traceroute-like tool capable of both giving IP and router level view.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

MMLPT is written in Python, and uses different libraries to work.

To craft, send and parse packets, it uses scapy:
```
sudo pip install scapy
```

To provide a rich graph view, and to compute the IP and router level graphs, MMLPT uses graph-tool, which is a boost C++ library with a python wrapper.   

Follow the instructions in the following link to install graph-tool. As the C++ Library makes an extensive use of metaprogramming and templates, it can take a while (up to 30 minutes on a recent laptop) to compile graph-tool: 

[Graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de)

### Installing

To install then, just tap:

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Running
To run a simple MDA-Lite traceroute at IP level, tap
```
sudo python MDALite.py destination
```
To run MDA-Lite traceroute at both IP and router level, tap:
```
sudo python MDALite.py -a destination
```
You can tap the following command for the different options

```
sudo python MDALite.py --help
```

Recall that on very large topologies, the measurement can take few minutes, up to 10-15 on very complex topologies.

If the text output is not verbose enough, you can ask for a serialized version of the graph that basically keeps all the informations of the traceroute with the -o option

```
sudo python MDALite.py -o traceroute.xml -a destination 
```

```python
from graph_tool import *
g = load_graph("/path/to/serialized/graphs.xml")

# Manipulate the graph via its properties.
v_properties = g.vertex_properties
e_properties = g.edge_properties
g_properties = g.graph_properties

# Example: ip_ids, print ip_ids of an ip_address
ip_address = g.vertex_properties["ip_address"]
ip_ids = g.vertex_properties["ip_ids"]
for v in g.vertices():
    if ip_address[v] == "an_ip_of_your_choice_in_the_traceroute":
        print ip_ids[v]

```
